        It is a procedure that uses a diamond tip which helps exfoliate the dead
        cells, helps reduce tan, stimulates collagen formation and leaves your
        face looking youthful. It is more effective than a regular facial and
        furthermore it does not contain any chemicals. It can be done every 4 to
        6 weeks or before any important event. Additionally it does not have any
        side effects and helps in control of acne.

          Aesthetic medi-facials help to improve the skin tone, texture, and
          collagen production and, thus, slow down the ageing process. The
          generic facials offered in salons are filled with unhealthy chemicals,
          generally using steam and bleach. Those products and procedures are
          not effective. The creams used in regular facials can cause harsh
          exfoliation of the skin, which can cause blockage of pores and result
          in active breakouts in acne prone skin and cause skin damage.
