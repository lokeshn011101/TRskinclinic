They can enhance the repair of damaged tissues by reactivating cells. With hair loss treatment, growth factors are multiplied, activating more cells.
It restores the function of hair follicles in the area where the injection is done, resulting in the growth of new hair from re-stimulated, formerly inactive follicles."
